I am a M.S. student at [Minnesota Research Institute](https://cse.umn.edu/mnri) advised by [Assistant Professor Karthik Desingh](https://karthikdesingh.com/) as part of [Robotics: Perception, and Manipulation Lab](https://rpm-lab.github.io/).

I spent the summer of 2022 working on the [Amazon-University of Washington Robot Manipulation Project](https://www.washington.edu/news/2022/02/09/uw-and-amazon-announce-creation-of-the-science-hub/). I completed my B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics at University of Washington. During my B.S., I worked as a research assistant at [UW Robotics and State Estimation Lab](https://rse-lab.cs.washington.edu/) on the project [Evaluating SORNet on a Geometric and Spatial (GeoSpa) Reasoning Dataset](https://chahyon-ku.github.io/sornet-geospa/).

My research interests lie in object manipulation for domestic robots. I am particularly interested in developing algorithms that enable robots to learn the relationship between multiple objects in cluttered environments from human demonstrations.
